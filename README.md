# Learning Log
Learning Log is a website that allows you to add a topic and write entries about that topic.
It runs on django. To run in a development server on Windows, navigate to the directory that 
contains activate.bat (ll_env/Scripts) and issue the command activate (if using Powershell
issue Activate). Then, navigate to the root directory and issue the command python manage.py runserver.
Then, open a browser and enter the URL localhost:8000. Enjoy!
